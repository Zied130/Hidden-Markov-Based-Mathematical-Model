# Hidden Markov Based Mathematical Model dedicated to Extract Ingredients from Recipe Text

The file first order hidden markov model uses the first order model to predict ingredient states.

The file second order hidden markov model uses the second order model to predict ingredient states.

The file ingredient extractor uses the modified Viterbi algorithm to predict ingredient states.

When a file contains code(1).py code(2).py , code(1).py is used to calculate results in first layer and code(2).py is used to calculate results in second layer , run code(1).py first then code(2).py in spyder, otherwise copy paste code(1).py on top of cof code(2).py when you want to calculate results on second layer.

train_all.txt is the dataset used for implementing codes. train1_all is the trained dataset test1_all is the test dataset in each fold.

Parts of the code used is from an udemy tutorial https://www.udemy.com/course/unsupervised-machine-learning-hidden-markov-models-in-python/

The tables in each file are automatically generated using pythontex
